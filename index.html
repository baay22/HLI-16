            <section>
                <p>Nothing exposes the dishonesty and corruption of the abortion industry more than the “mental health” exception for abortion. Abortionists routinely abuse this exception, no matter how carefully and precisely lawmakers draft it.</p>
            <p>This kind of deception has been going on as long as there have been laws against abortion.</p>

                <h2>Abuse of the “Mental Health” Exception</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Referring to those states that legalized abortion before <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, Dr. E. James Lieberman said, “In recent years, 90% of all legal abortions performed in the United States were justified on psychiatric grounds, since there are few physical conditions which stand in the way of normal gestation and parturition.”1 Dr. Benjamin N. Branch confirmed this number when he revealed, “Until June 1970, almost 90% of abortions in New York were in fact certified as necessary to protect emotional health.”2</p>
                <p>When government reporting requirements force abortionists to be honest, we find that abortions performed to preserve women’s mental health are very rare.</p>
                <p>From 1996 to 2020, the states of Florida, Louisiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota and Utah compiled data on the <a href="https://www.hli.org/resources/why-women-abort/"> reasons that women obtain abortions</a>. Of the 2.4 million aborting women surveyed, only 1.28% replied that they were having abortions to protect their mental health.</p>

                <h3>The Slippery Slope: Third-Trimester Abortions to Attend Rock Concerts</h3>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>As with the “<a href="https://www.hli.org/resources/support-abortion-preserve-womans-physical-health/"> physical health” exception</a>, it does no good whatsoever for pro-life legislators to attempt to strictly define a “mental health” exception in the law, because abortionists will simply manipulate it to cover all abortions.</p>
                <p>When the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts recently investigated partial-birth abortionist George Tiller’s abortion practices, it found that he did third-trimester abortions on teenage girls for extremely trivial reasons―because they were anxious over missing rodeo competitions and basketball practices, or wanted to attend rock concerts and proms.</p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 300px; width: 90%;" src="https://www.hli.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rock-concert-784x300.jpg.webp"></div>
                <p>Kansas legislators had done their best to draw up a very strict “mental health” exception for abortions, which could only be done if the continuation of the pregnancy would result in “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major physical or mental function.”</p>
                <section>

                </section>
                <p>In order to get around the requirement that a second physician confirm this diagnosis, Tiller hired laser hair removal technician Ann Kristin Neuhaus, who rubber-stamped every single request that was brought before her without ever meeting with any of the girls “needing” abortion. Neuhaus, in fact, used a computer program called Psychmanager Lite to automatically fill out the required forms days or even weeks after the abortions were actually performed, and received $350 for each “consultation.”3</p>
                <p>It is revealing that Tiller and Neuhaus claimed that all of their patients were suffering from “severe” mental problems, but did not refer a single one of them to a psychiatrist or a psychologist.</p>
                <p>So much for “caring for the health of women.”</p>

                <p>Because of this gross abuse of the mental health exception, the Kansas legislature removed it from the books in 2011 over the vocal opposition of pro-abortion groups, and Neuhaus lost her medical license in February 2012. Naturally, she complained that she was a victim of religious persecution and “abortion politics.”4</p>

            <section>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 400px; width: 100%;" src="https://www.hli.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/map-of-the-world-1536x1187.jpg.webp"></div>
                <p>Widespread exploitation of the “mental health” dodge is not a purely American phenomenon, because abortionists are the same the world over.</p>
                <p>For example, of the 1.9 million abortions performed in England and Wales during the ten-year period 2002-2011, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/statistics-on-abortions-carried-out-in-england-and-wales-in-2012"> 98.3% were for “mental health reasons” for both the woman and members of her family</a>.5 Under British law, the person who makes a determination of mental problems is not a psychiatrist, but the abortionist himself, who will lose money if he judges the woman to be mentally healthy!6 Perhaps this explains why abortionists labeled 100% of the abortion justifications for “mental health” with the conveniently vague terms “neuroses” or “depression,” something that no reputable psychiatrist or psychologist would ever do.</p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 200px; width: 100%;" src="https://www.hli.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/AdobeStock_228148450-e1576346719892-820x290.jpeg.webp"></div>
                <p>Professor Myre Sim, lecturer in Psychiatry at Birmingham University, recognized that abortionists are certainly not qualified to make psychiatric evaluations: “I was able to demonstrate successfully that psychiatry was competent to deal with all the psychiatric hazards of pregnancy, and that the day that a psychiatrist required a gynecologist to treat his patients has not arrived.”7</p>
                <p>In England, land of the free and easy “lunchtime abortion,” teenagers have as many as seven each―almost always under the “mental health” exception.</p>

                <h2>What about Suicide Threats?</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>One special aspect of the “mental health” exception for abortion is when women threaten suicide. Pro-abortionists, as always, emphasize the hardest of the “hard cases,” and, when everything else fails, insist that pregnant women who cannot get abortions will kill themselves in droves.</p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 200px; width: 100%;" src="https://www.hli.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/black-and-white-depression-dress-2369-784x300.jpg.webp"></div>
                <p>But pro-abortion feminist writers themselves have revealed that this assertion is a lie.</p>
                <p>The authors of <i>A Woman’s Book of Choices</i> admit, “Another pre-Roe standby that many women employed successfully was threatening or feigning suicide…. sympathetic doctors readily used any excuse, no matter how flimsy, to do what came in late pre-Roe days to be called ‘therapeutic’ abortions.8</p>
                <p>This book also shows women how to lie and be dramatic during abortion interviews:</p>
                <div style="background-color: #f3f1f1;">During the interview, weep, show anger, fear, disgust, outright destructiveness of your clothing or small objects, say, the ashtray on his desk which can be broken on the floor or against a wall. Don’t overdo this. You will be billed for the broken things later! Don’t break the doctor’s head. This is a “no-no”…. How’s your attention span?…. You can’t seem to concentrate on anything for more than a couple of minutes…. Be dull and very sad. Cry a bit. Just sit in silence, and make him repeat questions as though you hadn’t heard a word…. And now for the Manic Scene: Just like the opera, ladies! Brighten up, beam like a sunrise…. let your thoughts gallop wildly…. your speech flows like the Danube in flood time…. you might try taking off your shoes, kicking them all the way across his office, wriggling your toes. Then say, “That feels so good, I think I’ll take everything off.”9</div>
                <p>Countless experts in the field of maternal health―including many abortionists―have concluded that the risk of women committing suicide because of their pregnancies is minuscule. These experts have found that almost all pregnant women who threaten to commit suicide do so either to obtain an abortion or to attract attention to themselves.</p>
                <p>One of the most rabid and outspoken abortionists is Jane Hodgson, who edited a book entitled <i>Abortion and Sterilization</i>: Medical and Social Aspects, which frankly admitted that pro-lifers are correct in opposing “mental health” exceptions for abortion. The book made the crucial point that threats of suicide during pregnancy are almost never associated with the existence of the pregnancy itself, but with some other stress:</p>
                <div style="background-color: #f3f1f1;">The critics of liberal abortion legislation have rightly pointed out that granting abortion for reasons of `mental health’ is vague and constitutes a way of justifying abortion on demand. The term ‘mental health’ is indeed vague, and often serves as a cloak for a variety of indications to induce abortion…. [Physical] health is also a vague term; the vast literature relating to difficulties in measuring the health status of individuals and populations provides no consensus on how it may be defined in quantitative terms.

                    No claim can be made for a cause-and-effect relation between pregnancy and suicide. It appears that in the majority of suicide attempts during pregnancy, the suicidal behavior was unrelated to the pregnancy itself. Both the pregnancy and the suicide attempts seem to stem from stressful situations or internal conflicts, and they probably represent attempts to gain attention or to punish others.10</div>
                    <p>Indeed, over the past half century, dozens of medical studies and the personal experiences of many abortionists have shown that women often threaten suicide in order to obtain abortions, but almost never carry out their threats. These studies have also found that pregnant women are less likely to commit suicide than women who are not pregnant. See the endnotes for a long list of testimonies on this fact.11</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>We must keep in mind that abortionists are totally committed to their cause, which is making lots of money by killing preborn people. Is it any wonder, then, that they would stretch any exception to achieve what is essentially abortion on demand?</p>
                <p>A “mental health” exception for abortion always becomes just another part of the machinery of corruption and dishonesty that is characteristic of the abortion industry.</p>
